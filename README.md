==========
Assignment:
Take a document in English and print out the estimated probabilities
for each of the words that occur in that document.  Remove all
punctuation (quotes, commas, hyphens etc) before you perform your calculations.
Extend your program to calculate the probability of two words occurring adjacent to
each other. It should take in a document, and two words (say the and for) and compute
the probability of each of the words occurring in the document and the joint probability
of both of them occurring together. The order of the two words is not important
